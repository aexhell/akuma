# Akuma
## Installation
First, install the bot dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`.
Then, use the `.env.example` file to create the `.env` with your bot's token and client ID.
Finally, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in your terminal for running your bot.

You can change the `chalk` dependency to your preferred terminal package.
